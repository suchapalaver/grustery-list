# grusterylist
## requirements:
- If you need to set up git for the first time [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/setting-up-git) has a useful tutorial
- See [The Rust Programming Language's installation chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) if you want help installing Rust
## how to use:
- [clone the grusterylist repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
- make `grusterylist` the present working directory by entering  
`$ cd grusterylist` (no need to type the `$`, that's just a convention to show that this is a command line interface command)
- run `$ cargo run -- --help` for available options
### note
included JSON files respectively contain libraries of some groceries, some recipes, and an example saved list, which you could empty out manually to start from scratch. The `cargo run -- --list` option allows you to begin a new shopping list or use the most recently saved list.
